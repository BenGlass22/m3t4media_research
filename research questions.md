1. Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? What is it for? How does it work?

	A Generative adversarial network or (GAN) is a type of artificial intelligence machine learning system that consists of two neural networks in competition with one another, with the goal being to create new data (images, video, photography ect) based on a training set. An artificial neural network works a lot like a biological brain does, but unlike literal synapse connections the network transmits information through neuron like nodes that process information and distribute it to corresponding nodes. This allows for “learning” to take place, without programmed parameters a neural network is able to identify data based on previous information it has encountered. This is the sort of technology that is behind image recognition software. What a GAN does, is use these neural networks to not only process data but manufacture new unique data sets based on what information it has to process. The two competing networks are known as the generative network and discriminative network. The generative network is responsible for creating data that is statistically as close as possible to the original source material in that it is able to trick the discriminative network. The discriminative network more or less vets datasets only allowing for datasets that are from its perspective identical to the varying source material. For example if a GAN was trained from a series of photographs of peoples faces the generative network would through a learning series of trial and error create images that would be accepted by the discriminative network. This is why having a larger selection of source material would  lead to more passible or realistic final products. Image generator predecessors to the GAN would be the FVBN (Fully visible belief networks) that would produce images based on rules of probability to create images, drawbacks of FVBN systems are the amount of time it takes to generate an image, only being able to produce one at a time as well as lacking compounding learning which results in less passable potentially blurry images.

2. Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

	Ian Goodfellow is responsible for inventing the GAN in 2014 alongside seven other colleagues (Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio) while studying for his PhD at the University of Montreal. After a night of drinking at a local Montreal bar “Les 3 Brasseurs” and pondering with friends the idea of a computer could successfully develop photos on its own, Goodfellow thought of the discriminative GAN process. Later that night Goodfellow began writing the source code for such a program and thus the GAN was born. This gave Goodfellow a tremendous amount of celebrity within the world of AI and began working for Google’s “Google Brain” research team. At Google Ian developed an algorithm that could successfully transcribe addresses from googles street view images. He later went on to work for the organization OpenAI, a collaborative research institute founded inpart by Elon Musk aimed at combating the potentially disastrous results of machine learning and its global impact. Goodfellow went on to write a book entitled Deep learning in 2015, and as of now works at Apple within their machine learning department. One example of a more famous styleGan accessible on the internet would be the website “this person does not exist” which uses a styleGan algorithm to generate hyper realistic images of human faces, the algorithm used was created by the company nvidia and is recently being used by artists to create GAN generated art works. 
    
3. What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly noteworthy?

	The GAN technology despite only existing for the last six years has already made tremendous waves within the world of artificial intelligence, the internet, art, technology and even more traditional media. Specific milestone progress is hard to track as because since Goodfellow’s original conception in 2014 the technology itself has been accessible by the public and tech world alike. With every different encounter with the GAN there has been no lack of implementation, as of now there are around 10 distinct GAN types (the most recognizable being something like the styleGAN) and that is only within the last 5 or so years. Much like the focus of this class the GAN itself is a metamedium, as it both in many ways mimics and surpases the capabilities of the human brain. Something attributed to Goodfellow that sort of sums up the brevity of his invention is that he has given the computer an imagination.
